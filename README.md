99problems
==========

I got 99 Problems and e-reader rendering are all of them.

This is a global list of e-reader rendering bugs. It serves three purposes:

1. to help eBook producers combine our knowledge of the issues we deal with daily in e-reader rendering;
2. to show how abysmal some of these rendering systems are. Really, someone should fix these problems;
3. to provide potential hacks or solutions around these issues


Add an issue, tag it with the device, take a shot. Do it again.

More to follow...the issues list is currently pretty bare, but Iâ€™m sure we can change that quickly.
